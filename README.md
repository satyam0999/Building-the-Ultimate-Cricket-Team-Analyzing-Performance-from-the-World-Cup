# Building-the-Ultimate-Cricket-Team-Analyzing-Performance-from-the-World-Cup

To select the best 11 cricket players for the ultimate team based on their performance in the 2022 T-20 cricket world cup tournament,
variety of parameters were used to assess their performance. These parameters included strike rate, batting average, bowling average, economy, Dot%, Boundary% etc.
The data was extracted using web scraping techniques and then it was cleaned using numpy and pandas libraries in Jupyter notebooks. 
Then using DAX a data model was created that allowed to analyze the performance of players based on these parameters.
To ensure that ultimate cricket team of 11 players was capable of achieving a specific target, parameters were scoped to select players who could on average score 180 runs and defend 150 runs.
By carefully assessing the performance of players in each position based on these parameters, the top performers were identified and the best 11 players for the ultimate team were selected. 
It was also ensured that each player had the necessary skills and strengths to succeed in their respective positions, while also complementing each other's strengths to create a well-rounded and effective team.
Overall, this project showcases the value of data visualization in sports analysis. By using Power BI,created clear and interactive visualizations that helped to identify key insights and make informed decisions about player selection and team strategy.
